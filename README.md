# I try to learn Go
implementing the sha-1 algorithm is an interesting practice to get started with this language.
I found the algorithm on [wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithm#SHA-1) and [https://brilliant.org/wiki/secure-hashing-algorithms/](brilliant).

## how to use
compile the binary with
```shell
go build ./cmd/sha_practice/main.go
```
then run the programm in the terminal with the message as argument
```shell
./main abc
binary of message: 011000010110001001100011
